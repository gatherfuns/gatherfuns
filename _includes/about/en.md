**About me**

I’m a senior tourist, who loves life. I’d like to travel to anywhere. Almost every continent has my footprints, Euro, America and Africa. In there, I learn more, and try different new things. Of course, make lots of new friends. I love this life, and will go on. 

 I don’t know from when, I am fascinated with travel, from then on, I have become a senior overseas tourist. Every year I will give myself a period of time off, to enjoy a different life outside the world, to experience a different life, to meet the friends of other countries. My footprints all over the whole continent of Europe, of course, Asia and Africa also have my footprints. In every place, I will meet some local friends, appreciate the local customs, and record them all. Now, for the past 5 years, my footsteps will continue, and will not stop.
