> About me
 I donâ€™t know from when, I am fascinated with travel, from then on, I have become a senior overseas tourist. Every year I will give myself a period of time off, to enjoy a different life outside the world, to experience a different life, to meet the friends of other countries. My footprints all over the whole continent of Europe, of course, Asia and Africa also have my footprints. In every place, I will meet some local friends, appreciate the local customs, and record them all. Now, for the past 5 years, my footsteps will continue, and will not stop.
