**My** journey is the stars and the sea.

**For** people in the Mainland, the sea is somewhat out of reach, thinking of the lonely ship on the vast sea, there is a kind of isolated loneliness, but this is my journey.

**From** Labuan Bazo to Komodo Island, in the morning light, with a look of tired, set foot on the pier. The early risen fishermen have probably been floating in the sea, so the dock is not busy. Not out of the fishing boats crowded at the pier, thirty-two sailors sitting on the boat to rest, just as usual countless morning.

**We** take the boat is not large, two decks up and down, facing the sea breeze slowly, the cabin is a separate room for rest. The crowds of people on the pier were captured by me in one or two years. The slender Southeast Asian faces have experienced the vicissitudes of the summer.

**Inspired** by the dawn of the sea, the warm colors of the night did not wake up, reflecting the horizon of the mountains, but also a golden.

**Returning** to this quest, two major Komodo Dragon Reserves will be held, namely Loh Liang on Komodo Island and Loh Buaya on the island of Rinca, where the existing number of Komodo Dragons is around 1200, In the 1300-1400, but it is also the only remaining Komodo dragon in the world. This is not intended to offend here because female compatriots are not allowed to enter the Komodo Reserve if they are on official holidays. This does not discriminate against women, but the Komodo Dragon even has a bloodthirsty feeling that is particularly sensitive to bloody smell. A dinosaur-like vampire, really not a fuel-efficient lamp.

**Although** a little nervous, but there are still some worried that this road can not see the real Komodo dragon, the result is when you want to be a guide was found, but also even under the trestle. Komodo dragon first seen, it seems that there is no imagination of the horrors, and even have a look Meng Meng, hiding in the shade, but also no intention to take care of our group of uninvited guests.

**Into** midday noon tropical forests, although there is no common fault of Southeast Asia rainforest, but still surrounded by lush green, continuous ring in the forest, there are all kinds of bird sounds, but also when the wind passing through the groan when the sizzling sound.

**The** first time I saw that cotton grows on trees, completely subverting the previous understanding of cotton, cotton should not be the impression that are similar to the kind of tea, can be picked within reach? Dedicated administrator to show us the cotton in his hand, I think probably we are the improved version, and this wild state of the cotton actually hairy, and slightly darker color.

**After** a corner, the protagonist appears, this wild state of Komodo dragon slightly lean, looking at our group of uninvited guests, it seems a little ignorant. However, we can see its vigilance, looking around and looking around, raised blood vessels between the neck and neck, as if at any time will be the same
Of course, in addition to the Komodo dragon and wild boar, wildlife reserves really a lot of protection. For example, a look up will be able to see the white parrot, standing on the trunk of the dry, very much like "Rio Adventure" in the rhythm.

**Finally** a few Loh Liang Nature Reserve tidbits.
