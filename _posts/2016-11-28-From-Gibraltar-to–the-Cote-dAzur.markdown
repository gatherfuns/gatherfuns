**If** you are a geospatial or traveling fan or have a little adventurous blood in your blood vessels, you will definitely be interested in this map. Look, to the southernmost tip of Spain is also the southernmost city of Europe, Algeciras, as long as the further step - take more than an hour's ferry, you can board the ancient continent of Africa. Many more convenient and more comfortable and more proud! And here you can see some peculiar natural landscapes: the rocky Gibraltar that rises abruptly in the sea, the Strait of Gibraltar, which holds the Atlantic-Mediterranean passage closely, only 10 kilometers at its narrowest. Think about it, if once the blockade of the Strait, the ship in order to enter the Mediterranean, you have detour the entire African continent! Also, when the weather is fine, you can even sit on a boat looking to Europe and watching Africa afar!
Not much to say, if you are interested, please follow me. Maybe some day you will germinate this exploration of whim, walk smart back.

 > **First proceed to the southernmost point in Europe**

**Our** story starts in Madrid. That day, we bid farewell to the warm and beautiful Madrid, all the way south, toward the southernmost city of Europe - Algeciras Algeciras departure. This trip, we will cross the Strait of Gibraltar, landing in Africa. Then, along the west coast of the Mediterranean, head for the French Riviera.
Atocha station into Madrid is a pleasure. I do not know who whim, in the station built an area of ​​4,000 square meters, with more than 500 kinds of plants in the indoor rainforest garden. Inside the plants patchwork, green piece, a special air-conditioned duct emerges from time to time shares of air-conditioning, people refreshing. Growing in the stream is a small creature such as a tortoise that brings vitality and spirituality to the Botanic Gardens. The construction of such an ecological train station, than those who spend a lot of deliberate decoration of a chess high. For a traveler, a modern train station does not care much about the luxury of a building, regardless of whether it is human, comfort and convenience. Noisy metropolis lived for a long time, people want to return to nature, toward nature, even if it is to enjoy a moment of quiet, will make people feel happy and comfortable.

**Half** past eight, the train arrived at the terminal. Algeciras is located in the border seems not much attention for tourists, deserted, very quiet. At dusk, with the help of passers-by, we crossed into the booked family-run hotel. Taking into account only sleep through the night, the next day early in the morning, just close to the beach and convenient transportation, did not deliberately pursue the hotel's grade. Met two foreigners also go to bed, chatted. They are the mother and daughter from Australia, also want to Alzilas travel to Ceuta. I take the initiative to invite them to get the tickets first, but they are not in a hurry and plan to cross the sea at 10 o'clock tomorrow. See did not continue to talk about the interest, then carrying luggage back to the room.
Alhsilas Port is one of the three largest in Europe and the world's largest port: container, cargo and transhipment. It is Spain's largest container port and crude oil import port, and the warm climate, a longer beach, attracting tourists to come to vacation, is a natural winter resort.

**There** are many ways to Algeciras, the most common is to take the train. Run by Spain's Renfe is a local feeder specifications, small number of flights. The trains coming from the capital city of Madrid come in morning and afternoon every day, returning to each day and night. There are also trains to Malaga, Seville and Barcelona. Followed by the bus to and from Malaga or Seville. Due to the terrain, the bus saves more money and time than the railway. Málaga, in particular, travels along the coast, with its breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea.

> **Second across the Strait of Gibraltar**

**Nocturnal**, living in the seaside near the family hotel, remember early get up by boat, sleep intermittent. Noisy seagulls called non-stop race past the alarm, wake us up early. Curtains together, always want to see a trace of white, but the sky is still dark. In the past in other European cities, the morning usually four or five on the bright, here nearly six o'clock have not seen the dawn. We hurry up to get up, after 6 o'clock, the luggage stored in the hotel, then went to the seaside passenger lobby.

**The** sun rises slowly, dyed the distant seaside. Sunshine into the cabin, with a warm feeling, the pier is also gradually bright. I took the camera and walked to the starboard side of the starboard, where there was an unsealed notch that clearly looked out of the boat. Shore, stands a row of giant trusses and cranes, indicating the identity of Spain's largest cargo port.

**At** half past seven, the whistle sang and the trip through the Strait of Gibraltar officially started. Sow rolled up the water, and soon adjust the bow, add enough horsepower, began the trip across the Mediterranean. Looking at the cabin, it seems sensible to take the first boat. Small people in the cabin, empty seats everywhere. We sat on the port side of the ship looking out of the window across the glass and found a huge rock standing like a wall on our left, would it be Gibraltar? Know before traveling that we want to cross the Strait of Gibraltar, the sign is a rock. The ship sails, can not hit the direction, then ask the Commissar's sister, the Spanish girl pointing to the boulder on the left that is Gibraltar.

**That** is Gibraltar! We finally see the Gibraltar rock. At this time of the Gibraltar rock, under the shadow of the mist, looming, there is a sense of mystery. The Clippers have pulled out of the Gulf of Gibraltar, first hull against the Gibraltar rock, now is the stern. A wall of rock like a converted into a towering from the sea peaks, the image of the rock quickly changed. Just as Su Dongpo said: "As seen as the ridge into a peak, the distance varies."

**Actually** let us really see that the true meaning of the Gibraltar rock is when we return to Europe from Ceuta. At this time, sunny, sunny, clouds scattered fog, the outline of the rock clear, the construction of the above vividly. It is only at this juncture that we truly recognize the greatness of the Creator, the exquisiteness of nature.

**The** famous Lighthouse of the Europa Point is full of energy and stands at the southern tip of the Gibraltar rock. On the dark night, it guides thousands of wheels through the narrow fairway, and it is really great.

**It** did not take long before the dark, dark mountain appeared in front of it, hidden under the cover of the mist. As the Clippers advance, the mysterious continent of Africa opens its veil and the buildings on the shore are clearly visible. Ah, that's the continent of Africa, the destination of our trip. Finally, after forty-five minutes of sailing, our ship successfully reached the Mediterranean city of Ceuta on the African side of the Mediterranean.

> **Third Ceuta to explore**

**Ceuta**, a pearl on the edge of the Strait of Gibraltar. Geographically, it is in Africa, but it is Spanish possession in North Africa, under the Cadiz province of Andalusia. Sitting on the junction of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, Ceuta, facing Algeciras across the sea and bordering Morocco, covers an area of 22 square kilometers and has a coastline of 21 kilometers and a population of about 82,000, of which a large number Muslims, Jews and Hindus. Before 1986, Ceuta was a free port and has now joined the EU.

**On** the street, I can not see the slightest garbage. Street corner, the roadside tree lawn pruned modeled, tropical flowers open particularly gorgeous, the air was filled with fresh flowers. Such a beautiful environment completely subverts our traditional concepts. Did not expect in "black Africa" ​​there is such a beautiful flower paradise. Of course, this is just geographical Africa, which is actually part of the European Union. If not managed in Spain, I am afraid it is not like this.

**This** is an exquisite town focused on shaping the city's image. In the open space in the city, the streets and corners have some sculpture works. No, there is a group of sculptures on the Constitution Square on the left side of Paseo de la Marina Espanola. Sculptured on a plastic platform a column, the top engraved with Monument to the Constitution, the following is the city of Ceuta logo, then below is the inscription. Next to the cylinder stood a mother dressed in long skirts and was telling her daughter about her. From the inscription we have learned that this is a parable of the altarpiece of Ceuta and is the work of sculptor Francisco Lopez Hernández.
