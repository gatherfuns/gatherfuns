**Whenever** I want to breathe, I think of Austria. Look, this year is still the first in Vienna, Switzerland, Zurich and Geneva separated two or three. Only to have been there, will find that he had never breathed the real air, never seen the real blue sky, the original air can be so fresh, the sky can be so clear.

**Many** ALICE like to go to the Austrian village "wash the lungs" a few weeks. They are often in a mountain or mountain lake, choose a cabin-style family hotel, there are clean and generous rooms, rich food and drink, aroma sauna, hiking, hiking and cycling routes It is a daily turning pattern, you only have to enjoy the forests, lakes and the ecology of the original air. Austria sublime tourism to recuperation, enough to make people addicted.

**The** reason why this country can be so clean, in addition to the beautiful talent, is the superiority of education. Austria has been teaching talents for centuries, and its teaching is rigorous and admirable. Students who seek the impartiality of their lawsuits through lawsuits if they decide that the professor intends to make things difficult, and those who study medicine need at least 15 years to get a Ph.D., and many people at that time 35 years old, not as a doctor in some countries, less than 30. The higher the quality of the people, the better the environment and the easier and virtuous lifestyles.

**In** Austria, 83% of people are engaged in sports at leisure. In addition to skiing, running, swimming and hiking, Austrians are also fond of bicycling. Many families traveling by car or bicycle have a bicycle or sled for fitness and proximity natural. By 2009, cycling will bring economic benefits to Austria of 880 million euros, guaranteeing more than 18,000 long-term jobs and saving 450 million euros in medical insurance funds.

**This** way of life, coupled with unpolluted wines, beautifully-crafted art sweets, drinking Vienna coffee, listening to a classical piece of music, no matter how drowsy till the night catch up with the breakfast time in the dining room! It is no wonder that the Austrians on the street walked head-on, looking pampered and people lazy to fight for what manned lunar landing, GDP growth and holding the grand fame of the event, the real self-confidence from the calm life!
