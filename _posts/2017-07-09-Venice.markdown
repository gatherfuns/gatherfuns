**The** sea breeze blowing in the Mediterranean Sea,
I am sitting on Marco square,
Listen slowly melodious music,
Order a cold drink,
Look at ancient buildings,
Watching pigeons walk,
Look at different color of people coming and going,
Feel more comfortable,
No sadness
No excitement.

**The** sea breeze blowing in the Mediterranean Sea,
I also get a leaf boat,
Walk through the winding waterways,
The water flowing,
Sitting on the edge of the water alley stone girl,
Looked at me beautifully
I also looked at her, with a smile;
And my compatriots on the stone bridge waving each other,
Hello each other,
Exotic country reunion,
Another farewell.
