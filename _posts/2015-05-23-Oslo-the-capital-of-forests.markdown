**The** morning of midsummer in Oslo, the capital of Norway, is as cool as the early spring in the south of Yangtze River.

**Oslo** City Hall, 2005 Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony was held here.

**It** is said that Nobel himself has not made any clear explanation for the peace prize in one of the six major awards in Norway.

**Honorary** Terminal opposite City Hall.

**Norway** is the country that has the largest number of electric vehicles per capita in the world. Old royal palace walls slip of a charging pile.

**Mysterious** and majestic castle lined with trees.

**Norwegian** New Opera House is a unique style of building. Oslo is probably one of the few thriving cities in Europe. Norway is very rich because of oil, fishing and tourism.


**The** 200-year-old new palace is also a popular tourist spot on a plateau in Oslo. The flag of the royal family flying from the golden lion on the royal palace represents the king at the royal palace.

**Holmenkollen** Ski Jump is Oslo's iconic landmark. Jumping is called a brave game. With the development of the snow jump, the design and modification of the platform and the high-tech equipment, the record of snow jump from the first 21 meters to 142 meters has been continuously challenged to the limit for more than one hundred years.

**This** beautiful city, there are a lot of attractions worth visiting, but time is limited, not here for everyone to introduce one by one, if you have a chance, I hope you can come to this forest capital, feel its beauty.
