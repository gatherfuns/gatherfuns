**First** saw Ceylon (Negombo) red eye flight arrived Colombo, arrived just at 7 o'clock in the morning, at the airport literally washed a face to brush the lower teeth, although not sleeping well last night, but out of the airport immediately spirit, the heat wave came to us. Although the Colombo International Airport is the capital of the capital, but also too small, before having a good bus train master, that is, we want a car for 3 days of SAM. At the airport there are several places where money, the exchange rate is the same, first for money, or to eat no money for a good, fast, SAM has been waiting for us for a long time at the mouth, just before WeChat and his channel, say a time and flight number. I did not pay, he still keep time. Because Negombo is also not too many attractions worth visiting, and last night did not sleep, so let the driver to send us to the hotel to see if you can check, after the arrival of more than 8 points, the receptionist said to 10 points to check, then we want to still want to eat breakfast and the first driver to discuss these days the journey, then go directly to the scenic spots around, go back to rest at noon, go to the beach to see the sunset in the evening.

**Negombo** is also not too many attractions, in addition to various temples and many churches, tourists often go a few spots is the fish market, Negombo beach and lagoon of Negombo, in addition to the Holland canal from the picture looks good, wanted to go, and the driver said he was surprised to ask us, this place is the living area the environment is not very good, and the water was foul. Are you sure you want to go, I give up, what is not good for fish, can see through on the way to the hotel. So the first scenic spot that the driver took us was the temple, and none of them needed tickets.

**These** temples are not too big, they are the beliefs of the local people. After that, there came another white temple. Next to the temple, many mango trees are full of mango, and the first time to see it, is very curious. The temple is surrounded by elephants, and it looks spectacular. The temple took 20 minutes to finish.

**He** continued to travel to the famous St. Mary's Church in the local area, and Negombo was not big. The temples and churches were not far away, and a few minutes could arrive. Negombo is the center of the Catholicism of Sri Lanka. It is known as a small Rome. Most of the residents believe in Rome Catholicism, so there are many churches. The biggest and most luxurious of them is St. Mary's church near the post office. The church is decorated solemnly and elegant and very exquisite. There are solemn religious murals on the ceiling of the nave, is worth watching. The sun shines through the colorful glass windows, and the church is particularly sacred.

**There** were no tickets for St. Mary's church. There were many people in the church when they went to the church. We didn't go in and disturb them. We only watched it outside.
Several scenic spots in the morning are very close. The time for visiting is not too long. They are all done in 2 hours. Then they go back to the hotel for lunch, take a nap, replenish their strength, and go out at four or five p.m.

**The** evening came to the local famous Negombo beach, seawater and sand quality in general, but there are a lot of people come here to enjoy the cool night, wearing Plaid group are orphans, care them, take them to the beach.

**In** Sri Lanka, the crow can be seen everywhere, a lot of places together, a black, this beach is also strange, is not the sea gull, is actually a crow.

**The** local people take their children to the beach to play, watching the sunset, life is very good. Of course, we can't miss the beautiful scene, the camera does not stop.

**It's** very pleasant to take a walk on the beach in the evening, and it's not hot. The key is to take a free picture. We waited until it was dark before we left the beach and found a restaurant near our home to solve the problem of food and clothing. I have not used to eat when it comes to Sri Lanka's food, such as fried rice, like Southeast Asia are also, especially love to eat Thailand, the rice is very good, but Sri Lanka's m feeling a little cooked, and they also love spicy taste, strange, there are a variety of curry, their customs and India like love, with the hand, so every time I try to eat Thai food, pizza or KFC.
