**Overseas** travel countries need to pay attention to customs, overseas travel, we donâ€™t want to do is to offend the locals. You must think this is easy, as long as you know polite, speak with "please", "thank you", do not arbitrarily open local jokes, elegant, dress properly, you can be assured of peace. However, the fact is not the case, let me look at the details that I need to pay attention to for you.

> 1. Use your left hand
In the Middle East, India, Africa and other parts of the world, people think the left hand is very dirty because the left hand is the hand that is used to clean the toilet after going to the toilet. Therefore, shaking hands with the left hand in these places, touching food, touching other people and giving gifts are not accepted by the locals. Well, left-handers feel the deep malice in this world.
2. Take a taxi back seat
In Australia and New Zealand, if you take a taxi and sit in the back seat alone, some taxi drivers think you treat him as your personal driver, a move that does not respect him. They also hope you can sit in front of your seat like a friend. However, for safety reasons, we still recommend single female passengers to sit in the back seat.
3. Tipping questions
If you know the tip of the United States, do you know that it is not popular in Europe to tip? Moreover, tip in Japan is considered an affront to others. So before you go to any country to play, it is best to find out whether there is custom to tip. Otherwise, it will not be good to spend more money and then resentment.
4. Hands in your pocket
Many men like to put their hands in their pockets while walking or waiting, but remember that this act in Turkey represents disrespectfulness and rudeness. Your unintentional move may be disgusted and despised by the locals. Do not hide your hands in your pocket while you go to Turkey.
5. V-shaped gestures
The legendary "scissors hand" is a lot of girls in the camera when the established action, if not to a scissor hand, do not know how to pose. But if the girls went to the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, every time a photo was taken, scissors would be taken by passers-by, as the gesture was an insulting gesture on the ground, equivalent to the vertical middle finger.
6. Exposed sole
After sitting down, many people routinely tilt their legs and inadvertently reveal their soles, but in most parts of the Middle East this move is rude. In the Arab culture, soles are considered dirty and unreadable by others. Before 1995, U.S. Congressman Richardson went to Iraq for diplomatic talks and he raised his arms in conversation with Saddam Hussein. Iraqi leaders immediately felt offended and angrily left the scene. Visible in advance to understand the doorway of the locals is important.
7. Fingers crossed
In many cultures, cross fingers indicate good luck. But if you cross your fingers for good luck on the streets of Vietnam, it's sure to be watched by many people. Because the gesture is very similar to the female genitalia in Vietnamese culture, cross-fingering in Vietnam is considered very vulgar.
8. Touching others head
When you see a cute child may unconsciously photographed his head, but in a large number of Buddhists in Sri Lanka, Thailand and China is a taboo. Buddhists think the head is sacred and the soul is the place, so do not touch the head with your hands.
9. Thumb up
Thumbs up in western Africa, South America, Iran, Sardinia, Israel, Thailand, Afghanistan, Italy and Greece do not mean "appreciation," "appreciation," "encouragement," etc. In these regions, it represents a different negative meaning. Do not just do this action, so as not to anger the locals.
10. Ok gesture
In the United States the gesture means everything is fine and everything is fine. But in Brazil and Germany it is a curse. Also in France, Venezuela and Turkey, the moves have their own negative meanings. If you want to do this action, may wish to think there is no alternative way.

**After** reading these customs is not more than a layer of longing for overseas travel it? Travel, more is to look at the customs of different places, feel the local culture, understanding them, respect them, can make the journey a little more different feeling.
