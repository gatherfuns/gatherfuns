**There** are about two types of people who travel to India:

**Bollywood** looked handsome and beauties, yearning for exotic holidays, and plans to make a bunch of beautiful photos. Do this need more money, access to five-star hotel, the door shuttle bus.

**There** is a person who heard a variety of wonderful stories, but also happened to look tired of the boss's face, could not wait at the moment to leave the desk this is the wrong place to go on an adventure journey. Even wild monkey robbery, have been deprived of elephants in the head at the expense of. Most of these people come to India to do so.

**Because** I have no money, I should be considered a second person. I have always been curious about this piece of land which gave birth to the Buddha, Ganesh, millions of other gods, and delicious curry.

**So**, one winter morning, I sat on the bank of the Ganges with my travel partners.

**Varanasi** is a sacred city: Buddhism was first born here more than 2,500 years ago and a religion affecting thousands of years later was born; more than that, Varanasi is Hindu and Zener The first of the seven holy city.

**Hindus** believe that if they die here, the soul will be automatically freed from painful reincarnations and saved and freed, so here ancient times all Indians worship. Every Hindu who is economically viable wants to rent a house in Varanasi when he was an old man and die here; the remains were cremated open-air on the Ganges River and the remains were thrown into the sacred waters.

**As** a result, the city of this millennium has been enveloped in the smoke of firewood, immersed in the smell of sandalwood mixed with barbecue.

**When** I came to India to make a hotel reservation online, I specifically searched for keywords "clean" and "tidy". Arrived at the hotel front desk, a really good look: the floor shiny, cool breeze. But as soon as she turned round the corner and walked into the few aisles, she immediately saw gray covered wires climbing up the corner, and the greasy fan struggling with creak. As for the toilet in the room Well, it should be said to look clean, but always feel the color is full of stories.

**In** fact, we walk into the street, it is better to squeeze into the alley more appropriate. Every street is full of ... uh ... moving creatures: men, women, jumpers, cars, kids, jumping goats, impatient dogs, dogs who do not understand why dogs are so impatient Very disdain for the monkey ... ... roaring motorcycle at a speed of not less than 60 km from the space 20 cm before the man and the cow flew, from time to time in front of the child to the naked ass to a brake, splashing a mud; next to the shop The traffickers looked for the opportunity to rush into this turmoil and drive all visitors who looked like foreigners or carrying their bags to their own store. Behind all this, a team of chanting sutras, the funeral procession carrying bodies of silk and garlands, was struggling to pass. More or less people will be next to the cow or monkey squeeze a few centimeters, give way to the souls. after all. Here they are the protagonists.

**Talking** about the dedication of young people in India, there is one thing that can not stop them: foreign girls, especially fair-skinned foreign girls. Any girl walking alone will inevitably be asked to take pictures together. Even someone came up, but not even the phone, I only hope you can take one with their cell phone, and then cheerfully go away.

**Any** girl here may be more or less feel that they are the most attractive people in the world, but unfortunately this illusion will not last long. Soon one day, you will run into numerous people who take pictures and photograph, can not walk together, can not get rid of bad luck.

**This** is a magical kingdom where you will experience a different kind of fun.
