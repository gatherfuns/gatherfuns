**When** the dawn of the Mediterranean oblique sprinkled on the Chateau d'If mottled pillars on the seat of Alexandre Dumas's "prison count" instant faded books of the haze, scattered shrubs with dew at three sides of the city of Marseille could not swing.

**This** is Marseille, Alexandre Dumas's favorite city.

**This** is Marseilles, a city full of light and shadow details.

**Detail** is not only the particle of time, the chain of process, but also the most abundant expression of history. Numerous literary giant, musicians have used heavy ink painter painted the 2500 history of the ancient city. Now, we do not want to go along the old age courtesy forward, and to further explore the first submarine people had dabbled in Marseille mood.

**Go** to the unknown light and shadow

**With** the smell of the sea breeze wrapped the whistle blowing, standing at the port of Marseilles the marina, deep blue and blue over the front let people fall into a reverie. What's under this two continents? Why is this one of the most popular Frenchmen's longing for the Gulf? What is the undersea world under the reef ahead?

**As** meditation, sailing chant pierced the quiet, kayaking, diving suits, one oxygen bottle onto the deck, Captain Lusef speaking in a thick accent about the sea diving guide for us, although some words did not hear, but the captain of the "waving" enthusiasm for the presence of all the sea is full of confidence and expectations.

**Sailing** time is not long, about 20 minutes later, the bow facing the current direction of life stopped, a whistle, the ship immediately rang the Marseille people are most familiar with the "Marseillaise", seaman point of marching music skillfully and busy, then all is ready. After wearing neat, all the captain of the captain moved to the 3 canoe, whipped the body of the sea, and was unconsciously confused by its clarity. How deep is the deep blue water in the earth? Are there any sharks in the sea? In the face of an increasingly tense question, life is very easily, just waved his hand and smiling without a word.

**As** the yacht went away, the yacht floated on the deep blue and near black sea, giving a slight fear. A boat, in addition to the heartbeat and water sound no sound. "Cave diving" because of its unique visual experience and great difficulty, is always chasing global diving enthusiasts, and focus of this trip is to explore Marseille near the mysterious rock cave Yves island mystery.

**Slowly** around the sharp rocks, finally stay in a noisy little bay, here is not only in the swimming circle on the child, there is a fly boat dragging skateboarding in the water.

**Too** late to enjoy these very lively, can we check each other equipment, with a raised him, plop turning into the water.

**Is** there a rainbow on the bottom of the sea?

**Cool**, cool.

**Perhaps** the morning sun is not as warm water, cool water for us with a string of potential bubbles more deep, along the cliff dive can see many rare corals and shellfish, yellow, blue, green fish surrounded by coral and seagrass for foraging.

**When** dive to 10 meters when the sun has been difficult to penetrate the sea, we use the overhead light beam to illuminate the seabed, a glowing light high cave appear in the eyes.

"**There's** a rainbow on the bottom of the sea?" It can not be communicated, but it can be felt from the movements and eyes of everyone. At first, we thought they were luminous fish. However, when we were near the cave, we found that many Cathedral stained glass were scattered in the submarine cave. Seemingly inadvertently, light can not only illuminate the whole cave, but also give out a colorful light.

**Bypassing** the cave, a huge natural Grottoes resembling the size of the theatre appeared. It wasn't enough to identify the direction. Suddenly, a rising gesture reminded everyone to go up as soon as possible, because there was a large fishing boat that had been submerged below the cave. The submersible feared that there would be dangerous currents or large marine organisms in the wreck.

**Broken** sunken ships, broken mast, scattered debris... The pictures that can be seen in the film make us curious and shocking, and no one is willing to give up the "treasure". The bold adventurer grabbed the mast and tried to stand on the bow, as if Columbo had opened the American scroll.

**Because** of the limit of oxygen, after a short stay, people were forced to hang up and hang up to protect their bodies. When looking at the sea together hovering, almost 10 Everfount bubbles constitute a swing beam, carefully check found, inadvertently we have to go up just people lively play area, not only the shuttle head shining fish, long red blue and green channel and various swimming ring and trying to pull the child they left behind.

**At** this moment, we seem to have become a fish on the bottom of the sea. Although the sea is an ordinary scene, it seems to be another world, a world that does not know our existence. There, people live happily. Happy colors bring great joy to the atmosphere. They need not worry about danger, worry about oxygen capacity, and do not need to worry about their health.

**To** experience the limit of life in serenity

**Light**, weak, but the color of the sea world.

**Shadow**, not clear, but constantly changing between the moving and static.

**At** this moment, we believe that everyone has gained some experience on the bottom of the sea, so that all the journeys can be ended so smoothly, and a sudden thought is full of mind -- how to sleep on the bottom of the sea?
So I slowly closed my eyes and let my body hold my balance, and suddenly I found that the seabed was so quiet. While experiencing quiet, the most intense reaction is fear. There are many fears: worry about direction, drowning, worry about sinking, lack of oxygen, and worry about suddenly seeing big creatures after opening eyes.

**At** that moment, the rapid heartbeat is still vaguely remembered. And this simple closed eye made me feel the tiny and fragile life. I even started to think, can a eyelid be able to resist so much fear for us? The answer, of course, is negative.

**Marseilles**, let me harvest the sky I have never looked up to.

**Marseille**, let me have penetrated the understanding of life.
