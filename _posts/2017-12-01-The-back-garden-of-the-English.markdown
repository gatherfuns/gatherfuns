**The** center of Grasmere town is located in the English Lake District National Park, because of beauty and a landscape of lakes and mountains unique cultural atmosphere has attracted numerous tourists from around the world to.

**This** is a typical British town, only one main road, both sides of the main road, winding narrow alley as many tree branches in general. When the weather is good, the only fish and fries shop in the town is lined up in front of the line. People were holding the golden cod fish and sitting near the river. They looked at the swans and wild ducks who were combing the feathers in the water, enjoying the delicious food.

**If** you go along the river to the south, it will not be far away to see Grasmere lake, surrounded by hills. The deep and shallow green hills are stained into the lake water, like a halo stained English water color. Sometimes I could see the flock of sheep halfway around the water, like the white clouds.

**Many** scholars have learned the inspiration here, and the lake area is also known as the "back garden of the spirit of the English." And the deepest origin of the town of Grasmere is William Wordsworth.

>Wordsworth, the poet of the Lakeside School

**Wordsworth** is a famous British Romantic poet and a representative of the "lakeside" poets. When he was young, he lost his parents, separated from his brothers and sisters, and was sent to his uncle's house. With their life and the sponsor of the embarrassment of living, give Wordsworth a heart always melancholy and moody.

**At** the age of 17, he went to Saint John College of University of Cambridge to study. It was at the time of the first industrial revolution, and the British society was in a period of intense transformation. At that time, there was also a luxurious and enjoyable atmosphere in the University. Wordsworth was inevitably influenced by it. He indulged in drinking parties all day and lost his time, and finally failed to graduate.

**After** his academic setbacks, he decided to leave his homeland and go to France, where he witnessed the great French Revolution. Wordsworth had been actively involved, but as the situation went out of control, he turned from fanatical support to deep disappointment.

**In** such a mood, Wordsworth returned to England. He felt tired inside and eager to find a paradise, away from the noisy world and quietly live a simple life. So he bought a house in Grasmere, a small town in the hinterland of the lake, and moved in with his sister, Dorothea. This house is the "lofts".

>Lofts in English

"Lofts" is a typical English country house, a street, a small garden. When the spring when I went to the end of the white stone wall climb with some green vines, top out of the light pink flowers, pale green tiled roof had many dark green moss, showing traces of the years.

**The** furnishings in the house still maintain the appearance of the early nineteenth Century. The narrator told us that all this was in accordance with the habits of Wordsworth at that time. Furniture and decoration are very simple. 

**Even** Wordsworth's study only has two small desks. On the side near the window sill, there is a bunch of daffodils in the ordinary white vase, which is the poet's favorite flower. The flooring of large stone pieces and the walls inlaid with wooden bars make the light in the room seem somewhat dark. It is not hard to imagine what a scene is here in the long and cold autumn and winter season in England. Perhaps in those days with short days and nights, Wordsworth wrapped up his thick coat and looked at the snowflakes falling in the dim sky outside the window to catch some inspiration. The flames in the fireplace and beating, reflecting the warm light in the window, and let him feel a real world.

**From** the beginning of early spring, the best time has come. In the first all over the mountains and plains out of a clump of daffodils in micro warm wind time away, covered from the town to the Grasmere Lake Road, then rose, rose, peony...... Flowers of different colors are open and ornament on the green land. On such a day, the poet would go for a walk on the lake, or to Yamanaka Kenyuki. He was close to nature, and the beauty that happened between nature was transformed into a magnificent poem in his pen.

**Wordsworth** wrote a famous poem: "I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high over vales and hills, suddenly I saw a large flowers, golden daffodils everywhere. They opened in the lake, beneath the trees, they are fluttering and dancing with the breeze."

**This** is the wind of Grasmere lake spring day, even after 200 years later, in this piece of land still can see the scenery described in the poem.
