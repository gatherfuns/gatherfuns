**Lift** Brussels, compared to Paris, London, Rome and other world-famous city, seems to belong to the European "second-tier cities." When we visited "France, Italy and Italy, the Seven Seas Tour", itinerary did not appear, only from France to Holland on the way, after passing by it. However, it is such a low-key town, a major European international organization, favored by her. The European Council, the European Commission, the EU Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are headquartered in Brussels. In addition, more than 200 international administrative centers and more than 100 diplomatic missions are also set up headquarters or offices here. Because of this, 27% of Brussels residents come from all over the world. Brussels, the important venue for international diplomacy and Europe's transportation hub, has truly become the "European capital."

**If** the city associated with celebrities, humanities will enlarge. The same is true of Brussels, one of Europe's cultural centers, where many world-class greats such as Karl Marx, Victor Hugo, George Gordon Byron, and prodigy musician Mozart have lived and given the city has left many stories. It is with this thought, when I walked into Brussels, admiration arises spontaneously, of course, it "canâ€™t be underestimated"

**Brussels** lies on the banks of the Sena River, at the heart of the Beatles Railway, with the flat Flanders Plain to the north and the slightly undulating Brabant Terrace to the south, averaging 58 meters above sea level. A thousand years ago, this piece of land in Brussels was only a swamp of the Seine. At the time, King Charles of France built the first castle on the island and named it "Broekselle." By the fourteenth century, Brussels had the second city wall, thus forming the Pentagon city preserved to this day.

**Into** the city get off the car, we visit the first attraction is downtown Brussels City Hall Square. Pedestrians in Europe are sparsely populated, with leisure, work in spring, summer vacations, strikes in the autumn, winter holidays, plazas and seaside centers all over the country. Once in the square, it was fascinated by the numerous rows of gothic buildings around the square, especially in the medieval city hall of Brussels, which is the most typical Gothic building in Belgium. The whole building was built in three different periods, Expansion and renovation, it formed the current scale. Opposite the town hall was France's Louis XIV's palace, is now the National Museum. However, it was this Louis XIV. A mass of artillery fire in 1695 nearly destroyed the entire square. After five years of reconstruction, the square gradually repaired the present scale.

**Built** in the 12th century, the rectangular plaza, 110 meters long and 68 meters wide, the ground is entirely paved with granite, is one of the most beautiful squares in Europe, and even the great writer Victor Hugo to this are amazed, praised her For "the world's most beautiful square." The main square is the historical witness of many major revolutionary events in Belgium, where the revolution broke out in 1830.

**Already** heard of Belgium has a "world's most famous cute child" - urinary children in the company, came to Brussels, of course, to report. Just a quarter of an hour's walk from Town Hall Square to the corner of Twilight at Twain Street and Oak Street. From afar, there has been packed with attracted people from all directions, come near, I realized that this statue of five-year-old child is much smaller than expected, only 53 cm high. However, the story behind him is far more impressive than the bronze statue, resulting in the spread of multiple versions.

**Brussels**, my travel career in the time, only "a passing", but it is a glimpse of this, often rippling in my mind, time-honored, profound and meaningful.
