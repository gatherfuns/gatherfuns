**Naples**, located in the Kan Pernia region of Italy, is an ancient city with a long history. In Italian, however, Naples (Napoli) is the meaning of the "new town". Today, Naples is the largest city in southern Italy. Naples port is also one of the main seaports in Italy. Once the summer resort of Rome emperors is now full of a cruise ship.

>The port is the starting point and the end

**Naples** city to the southeast of Italy's most famous volcano Vesuvius volcano eruption, 79 AD to Pompeii overnight to ashes. At the port, seems to be able to hear the sound of the distant ships, however, you may not know the enemy or ally. In 600 BC, the Greeks built in this city, Naples in twelfth Century by Norman occupied Sicily in thirteenth Century to become the capital of the kingdom of Spain, in fifteenth Century by the Lacan Dynasty, in eighteenth Century to accept the Vienna Habsburg command. In the fortress of Naples, in the change of power, the historical stories of Europe were congealed in a city.

**Naples** port located in the old city is a passenger transport port. Naples port is very prosperous. Many Mediterranean routes are passing through this area, especially large cruise ships. There are boats in a continuous line from here or arrive every day, the port is always crowing. Although Europe railway traffic is very developed, but the train arrived at the seaside, and from the rickety deck set foot on land the feeling is different: the former is the home just click into place.

>The old city does not change for a thousand years

**From** the port area of Naples, we can see the historical center of the city. It was listed in the world cultural heritage list in 1995, which is like a miniature of the long history of the middle ages, leaving behind the imprint of the Mediterranean and even the whole European culture. For tourists like me, the most interesting part is to look for an open point of view, overlooking the panorama of the old city. The churches and castles, which belong to different ages, interlaced each other and spelled a fantastic and charming painting.

**When** I went to Naples and in summer, unfortunately with the rain, the port is not the smell of wet from rain or sea. Little rain, thin thick rain falls on the shoulders of joy, even some pleasant. Most of the old cities in Europe are similar but different. They are similar to castles, churches, and walls with brick and stone patterns. They are different in historical background, architectural features and regional characteristics. The words that best reflect the characteristics of Naples are, in my view, the "ocean". The salty sea breeze through the land and people of Naples's character. They like the warm sunshine, like the ocean through the net.

**Now**, the old city has become the origin of Naples, looking from the old city to the port, it seems to have the sense of the ancient and modern. The port has become more modern, metal boom, container ships everywhere, also put on a metal shell, a fuel engine, but they are still behind the ocean at the Odysseus home.

>Naples is all here

**Before** coming to Naples, a friend who had been in Italy for a few years described the scenery of Naples port area. "No matter in oil painting or in reality, it is beautiful and unforgettable". From the sign of the new fort of beautiful decoration, luxury to the magnificent Naples palace, from San Carlos theatre to a foundation called the European art in South Italy style Piazza dante...... The beautiful scenery is within walking distance. Along the way, it is like walking into the picture scroll, with the thick and thick oil painting and the sunshine kissing the rain and dew.

**Naples** used to be the center of Sicily kingdom. Up to now, a set of "Sicily" rule is still in operation. For my foreign guest, Naples always has a charismatic charm with some rivers and lakes. There is a proverb in Italian, which generally means: "to Naples, the death of the evening." I don't have that deadly romanticism, but from the port all the way, it's always as good as it is.

**Round** a circle back to the port, the rain had stopped. It seems that the young girl, with a red umbrella, jumps two steps over a small pool of water. There were still water drips on the bench, and the old man with silver hair pulled out a handkerchief to wipe it clean and made a "please" pose for me. "Grazie.", I only learned to speak Italian after a long time, and then sat down at the port to guess which ship was going to sail and bring Naples's feelings and dreams to the distance.
