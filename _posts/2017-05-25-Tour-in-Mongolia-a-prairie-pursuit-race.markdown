**In** May, in this colorful season of mountains, I decided to give myself a fake trip to a "special trip." Did not find a suitable destination on the internet, but did not forget this "special trip" deep down. A meeting between friends made me a final destination for this "special trip." After the party was over, I repeatedly searched several key words on mobile phones, hunting in Mongolia, and the beauty of Mongolia. Peng Pai passion, endless joy! Prairie is not strange scenery for most people, but for me it is like paradise. The scenery of cattle and sheep in the grass makes us return to the primitive life. But also in the prairie Gobi pick agate, return to innocence, away from the hubbub! What do you think you can watch? The temptation to experience this exciting hunting trip is the key.

**Many** people on the issue of hunting dissent, hunting in Mongolia is protected by law, this is legal behavior. Mongolia has a land area of 1,560,000 square kilometers and sparsely populated areas. Too much wildlife can destroy the ecological balance of the local species. Therefore, the introduction of hunting policies in Mongolia, artificially adjust species ecological balance. Of course hunting species or expressly provided. Must not be indiscriminate, the consequences I will not do more explanation, you know.

**After** a 6-hour drive finally reached our hunting destination, everyone took out their own photography equipment, a variety of strange and intoxicating shooting position, everywhere is a large screensaver. But I have no mobility, blankly standing on a soft green blanket, in fact, the monologue was shocked, wait on this green carpet back and forth rolling, do not know if anyone and I think the same.

**Now** everyone is hungry, the club arranged for us a hearty dishes, whispering tell you are mainly based on meat. This time you can let go to eat, we talked and laughed at the dinner table, watching the stars on the prairie after dinner, gossip homely, from time to time some people cheer coax, look! meteor! It feels good and comfortable. At night, everyone returned to Mongolia to sleep, I was the first time to live in yurts, especially happy.

**Wake** up in the morning, curtains have a fresh wind pull on the face, very comfortable. The lake in front of the camp contains many ducks, pike, and philosophers (trout) that can fish at the lake.

**Hunting** is generally divided into night hunting, hunting, hunting, the club's first project is night hunting, but also the most exciting project. The dark and stormy night chasing the prey stimulation, let our team eager to boil. A car 4, in front of the driver and guide the hunting, as the name suggests Guiding Hunting is the name of the person you shoot the prey, and my screen name (one step away) in their shooting position on standby, waiting for the guidance of hunting order. Suddenly, there was a deer on the left hand side of the car, which was judged as a shootable animal. One step further said it was a quick shot down later. Do not forget to come back to me gestured a victory position. After two night's night hunting, also harvest deer, hare.

**Hunting** prey in Mongolia not bring back the country, can only choose to eat! These days are game-based, stir-fried, barbecue, kebabs, etc., have to say that weight in Mongolia these days also have a full sense of accomplishment.

**This** is a special trip, just a few days, not only received the prey, but also reaped a group of friends, together with the gun to work hard together harvest happiness! Thanks to every friend I met during the trip, because of you, this trip is more perfect.
